What Happened To Advertising?
=========================

## `Introduction` 

Why is it all of a sudden so important that we ''like'' our favourite brand of butter on Facebook? 

Hype and bullshit are nothing new to the world of advertising, but things are getting out of hand.

Why don't people in advertising like their jobs anymore? Interrupting people is fun, if you do it in a witty way, à la Bernbach; or nasty, if you punch people in the face, à la Rosser Reeves.

In any case, it's their job. Why do they want to do something else?

What is all this nonsense about "branding campaigns", or "interactive advertising" or the suddenly so-important "conversations" between a brand of butter and consumers? 

Isn't coming to terms with the fact that people on average don’t like ads and have more important things to do in life other than hearing from companies the first, insufficient and yet necessary step to end the delusional thinking and start doing (creative) work that actually sells products?

What follows is part personal story of the ups and downs of life in the Start-up world; part reflection on the nature of Advertising, what the Web has done to it and what it's doing to it. 

And part hallucination. Because it's not easy to live in a world where we're supposed to have conversations on Social Media with brands of butter and shampoo and not lose it all.

I will try to answer the following questions: what has happened to the Creative Revolution? Why has advertising slid from where it had worked so hard to raise itself – from being a simple thing which is hard to do, using creativity to persuade people to buy something – to being an over-complicated exercise which is apparently accessible only to the specialists who know the tricks of the trade and the jargon, but which doesn't solve the problem of creating demand for a product? 

Which players gain the most and which lose the most from the current sad state of Advertising? Why are ''branding'' campaigns so popular? What has advertising on the Web become? Is the Web itself a lemon for companies? Who wins and who loses when advertising loses its creative edge and becomes pompous empty talk about branding, cold ''science'' as in today's advertising on the Web, or the ridiculous and unaccountable bullshit we see in Social Media Marketing? 

Is the move to pay-per-results championed by the Web a further step away from the three-Martini lunches and old-boy networks and towards a more open and meritocratic ecosystem? Or is it a step backwards from the Creative Revolution, back to a system where the only things that count are Media buying and scientific number crunching, and creativity is at best a by-product? And is it good science, or is a lot of it just bullshit we don't have the tools or the time to debunk?

Are we wasting some of the best minds of our generation, programmers and mathematicians, just to make online ads suck a little less? Aren't there more interesting and more important problems to solve? What about those flying cars we were long promised? Better yet, isn't it time to fix public transportation systems? Is it possible that the way forward for companies is not more advertising, but less? Do less of it, and do it right. Do we need another Howard Luck Gossage?
